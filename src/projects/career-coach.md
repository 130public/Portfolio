## The data
According to [EIU survey data](https://edudownloads.azureedge.net/msdownloads/EIU-Microsoft-Education-Bridging-the-Digital-Divide-2020.pdf) (2020), 46 percent of students report being extremely concerned about getting a job after graduation, and over half said they had lost confidence in the value of a university/college education.

 A [recent survey of 2,200 teenagers](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20200911084002889) showed that half were questioning the value of a traditional ­­four-year college experience and were open to alternative paths to careers.
