## HAX Design Patterns
A set of flexible solutions to recurring human-AI interaction problems. The HAI Design Patterns are common ways of implementing the [Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/).

### What can I do with the HAX Design Patterns?
Given a guideline you wish to implement in a user-facing AI system, review the patterns for that guideline, pick one or more patterns, and follow their directions to create human-AI interaction that applies that guideline. The patterns are UI-independent and can be implemented in a variety of systems and interfaces.

### When should my team use the HAX Design Patterns?
We recommend referring to the patterns as your team is defining requirements for implementing the Guidelines or in the very early prototyping stages. The HAX Design Patterns require collaboration between UX Designers, PM, and AI/ML practitioners.
