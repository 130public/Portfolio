I look for systems in everything, it's kind of an obsession. The more specialization we create - the more we refine and refactor our world - the more apparent it becomes how similar we actually are. Perhaps as a result of this belief, my career has been a bit of a hacker's journey, moving between disciplines and roles, rarely settling into a specialty. I guess the more I learn, the more I realize how little I actually know.

As a designer, I strive to build tools that enhance human capability; to shorten the gap between an idea and its execution, however asymptotic that may be. I'm fascinated by how people interface with technology as a mechanism for self-expression, and how software can be used as a tool to amplify and embolden honest and meaningful connections. I'm also legally blind, so there's that.
