Design can help close the gap between AI algorithm outputs and improved human outcomes by keeping human needs, behaviors and goals at the center as we build our machines.

Goal-relevance.
Insightfully designed to satisfy the needs of human end users.

Handoff.
Human-centered design is needed to ensure that this “handoff” from computer to human happens when it should, and that it goes smoothly. 

Feedback loops.
Automated algorithmic decisions can reflect and amplify undesirable patterns in the data they are trained on, because AI will do as it is trained. Introduce user input appropriately and often.

Psychological impact.
Algorithms designed without a focus on their users’ human nature can impair user behavior. It can create compulsive, ... behavior.

Keeping Humans at the Center of AI Design

Human-centric AI algorithms should reflect the information, goals, and constraints that the decision-maker tends to weigh when arriving at a decision.


The overall decision environment—which includes both the algorithm and human decision-makers—must be similarly well-designed. An algorithm’s end users should have a sufficiently detailed understanding of their tool to use it effectively.

Users can also be trained to “think slow,” more like statisticians. Psychologists Philip Tetlock and Barbara Mellors have found that training decision-makers in probabilistic reasoning and avoiding cognitive biases improves their forecasting abilities. Building accurate algorithms is not enough; user-centered design is also essential.
